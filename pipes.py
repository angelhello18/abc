'''
Conclusion:
This program demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) using Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing module and a Pipe. 
It shows how a parent and child process can send and receive messages through a communication channel.
This simple example helps understand how processes can safely exchange data in parallel execution environments, 
making it a key concept in concurrent programming.
